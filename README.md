# Discord CSS Snippets

> [!WARNING]
> This project has yet to be populated with snippets- for now it's more of a proof of concept.

This is a collection of CSS snippets that alter the way Discord looks in relatively small ways. If you're looking for full themes that overhaul Discord's appearance, you'll want to go to [BetterDiscord Themes](https://betterdiscord.app/themes) (which also work on Vencord etc).

## Usage

Head to [the site](https://thelazysquid.github.io/DiscordCssSnippets/) and select the snippets you want to use. Then, click the copy button in the top right to copy the css.

There are several ways you can load this css:
* If you use [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app), put it in your Custom CSS
* If you use [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) / [Equicord](https://equicord.org/), put it in your QuickCSS
* If you use Discord in your browser, use an extension like [Custom CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-css-by-denis/cemphncflepgmgfhcdegkbkekifodacd)
